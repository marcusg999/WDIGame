This Game is Titled Zen Breakout. Inspired by the I Ching system of divination the object of the game is for the Red Paddle and Black paddle to collaborate to make contact with all of the Bricks. The Black paddle is faced with the selfless task of avoiding the bouncing ball at all costs in order to create a path for the red paddle to deflect the Ball into the Lines. In the spirit of ZEN Buddhism, there is no consequence if the Black paddle makes contact with the Ball. The ball passes through the black paddle. Serving as a casual reminder that all is actually an illusion.

TECHNOLOGIES USED: In the making of this game HTML, CSS and Javascript were utilized. The javascript canvas being the major component and the platform built upon. Programing the physics of the ball and the collision dynamics of the paddle and bricks proved to be challanging and took alot of research. My approach was to carefully plan out the workflow with Trello. First laying down and sizing the canvas to desired specifacations. Next drawing the required shapes to excecute the actual game play. This includes the paddles, Ball, and bricks; Adding physics and scoreing. switch turn functions came next.

Challenges included but werent limited my knowledge of working on the Canvas medium in javascript. Comprehending the mathamatics neccasary to acheive the physics of the components. 

Unresolved Issues: The inability to acheive collision function within the Red Paddle is what inspired the theme and vision of this Game. I also had an issue applying the Constructor Function to this game.

Creating this game I learned the basics of working on a canvas. I got an intro into animation drawing on canvas. I also got pratice creating functions and for loops controling the drawing of elements. Not to mention alot of googling!
